                <p>
                    We’ve been helping startups launch and grow their businesses. We help you to fill the gap between
                    development,
                    design and product management.

                    <p>When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed collaborators.
                        All aspects of our software development process are integrated, iterative and agile.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Our approach unifies design, development and
                        product management to create exceptional products.
                        We start each project by understanding your business goals,
                        the user’s needs and the product requirements.
                        Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions.

                    <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed
                        to
                        understand your
                        product vision.
                        The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.
                        Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.</p>

                    <p>
                        Our design practice offers a full range of services including branding strategy,
                        interaction and visual design and user experience testing.
                        Throughout your project, our designers create and implement visual designs and workflows,
                        solicit
                        user feedback, and
                        work with you to make sure what gets built is what is needed.

                    <p>
                        All engineers are fluent in the latest enterprise, mobile and web development technologies.
                        They collaborate with your team to write, test, and improve code on a daily basis, using proven
                        practices such as
                        test-driven development and pair programing.

                    <p>
                        Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding and testing, the
                        products we
                        build are always
                        ready to go live. This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve.
